        <p>
            Rashtrapati Bhavan is the official residence of the President of India. The Governor-General of India resided at Government House in Calcutta until the shift of the imperial capital to Delhi. <strong>Lord Wellesley</strong>, who is reputed to have said that ‘India should be governed from a palace, not from a country house’, ordered the construction of this grand mansion between 1799 and 1803 and in 1912, the Governor of Bengal took up residence there.
        </p>
        <p>
            The decision to build a residence in New Delhi for the British viceroy was taken after it was decided during the <strong>Delhi Durbar in December 1911</strong> that the capital of India would be relocated from Calcutta to Delhi. When the plan for a new city, New Delhi, adjacent to the end south of Old Delhi, was developed after the Delhi Durbar, the new palace for the viceroy of India was given an enormous size and prominent position. About 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of land was acquired to begin the construction of Viceroy's House, as it was originally called, and the adjacent Secretariat Building between 1911 and 1916 by relocating Raisina and Malcha villages that existed there and their 300 families under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
