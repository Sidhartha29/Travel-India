            The Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve is a wildlife sanctuary in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra, India. It is Maharashtra's oldest and largest national park. Created in 1955, the reserve includes the Tadoba National Park and the Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary. The reserve consists of 577.96 square kilometres (223.15 sq mi) of reserved forest and 32.51 square kilometres (12.55 sq mi) of protected forest.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            "Tadoba" is taken from the name of the god "Tadoba" or "Taru", worshipped by the tribal people who live in the dense forests of the Tadoba and Andhari region; "Andhari" refers to the Andhari river that meanders through the forest.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Legend holds that Taru was a village chief who was killed in a mythological encounter with a tiger. Taru was deified, and a shrine dedicated to Taru now exists beneath a large tree on the banks of Tadoba Lake. The temple is frequented by adivasis, especially during a fair held annually in the Hindu month of Pausha (Decemberâ€“January).
